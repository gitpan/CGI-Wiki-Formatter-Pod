NAME
    CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod - A Pod to HTML formatter for CGI::Wiki.

DESCRIPTION
    A Pod to HTML formatter backend for CGI::Wiki.

SYNOPSIS
      my $store     = CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite->new( ... );
      my $formatter = CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod->new;
      my $wiki      = CGI::Wiki->new( store     => $store,
                                      formatter => $formatter );

    Go look at CGI::Wiki to find out more. This module is distributed
    separately solely for convenience of testing and maintenance; it's
    probably not too useful on its own.

METHODS
    new
          my $formatter = CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod->new(
                               node_prefix           => 'wiki.cgi?node=',
                               usemod_extended_links => 0,
          );

        "node_prefix" is optional and defaults to the value shown above.

        If "usemod_extended_links" is supplied and true, then
        UseModWiki-style extended links "[[like this]]" will be supported -
        ie

          [[foo bar]]

        will be translated into a link to the node named "Foo Bar". (Node
        names are forced to ucfirst, ie first letter of each word is
        capitalised.)

        Note: You must have CGI::Wiki::Formatter::UseMod installed if you
        wish to use the "usemod_extended_links" parameter.

    format
          my $html = $formatter->format( $content );

        Uses Pod::Tree::HTML to translate the pod supplied in $content into
        HTML. Links will be treated as links to other wiki pages.
