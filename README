NAME
    CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod - A Pod to HTML formatter for CGI::Wiki.

DESCRIPTION
    A Pod to HTML formatter backend for CGI::Wiki.

SYNOPSIS
      my $store     = CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite->new( ... );
      my $formatter = CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod->new;
      my $wiki      = CGI::Wiki->new( store     => $store,
                                      formatter => $formatter );

    Go look at CGI::Wiki to find out more. This module is distributed
    separately solely for convenience of testing and maintenance; it's
    probably not too useful on its own.

METHODS
    new
          my $formatter = CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod->new(
                               node_prefix => 'wiki.cgi?node=' );

        Takes one optional parameter, "node_prefix", which defaults to the
        value shown above.

    format
          my $html = $formatter->format( $content );

        Uses Pod::Tree::HTML to translate the pod supplied in $content into
        HTML. Links will be treated as links to other wiki pages.

SEE ALSO
        CGI::Wiki, Pod::Tree::HTML.

        thanks to Steven W McDougall for extending the capabilities of
        Pod::Tree::HTML so I could make this work.
